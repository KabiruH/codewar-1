Divisible by X and Y
This is a solution to the "Divisible by X and Y" problem on Codewars, written in Ruby.

# Problem Description
The problem requires you to write a function that checks if a given number n is divisible by two other given numbers x and y. All inputs are positive, non-zero numbers.

# Solution
The solution provides two ways of solving the problem, one using the if statement and the other using the ternary operator.

Method 1: If statement
In the first solution, we use the if statement to check if the number n is divisible by both x and y. If it is, the function returns true, otherwise, it returns false.

Method 2: Ternary operator
In the second solution, we use the ternary operator to achieve the same result. The ternary operator allows us to write a conditional statement in a more concise manner. If the condition is true, it returns the first expression, otherwise, it returns the second expression.

# How to use
To use this solution, you can copy and paste the code into your Ruby environment or editor. Then, you can call the function and pass in the values of n, x, and y.


# Example usage
puts is_divisible(10, 2, 5)  # true
puts is_divisible(7, 2, 3)   # false
In this example, the function is called with the values 10, 2, and 5, and returns true. It is then called again with the values 7, 2, and 3, and returns false.

# Conclusion
This is a simple problem that can be solved in many different ways. These two solutions show how to use the if statement and ternary operator in Ruby to solve the problem.
